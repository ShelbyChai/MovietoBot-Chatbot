Director JT Petty uses this footage as a starting point to examine the classic comparison between filmmaking and voyeurism, particularly within the horror genre. He goes on to investigate this connection further, but rather than looking to classic horror films, Petty explores the seedy underground genre of fetish films.

The most notorious of these is a series called ""S&Man,"" where voyeurism takes center stage as people are unknowingly followed with a camera. Petty plunges headfirst into this world of bizarre fetish films, and comes up with mesmerizing interviews with the producers and actors of these movies.

Men like Jan Zumbach, Witold Urbanowicz, Miroslaw Feric and Tolo Lokuciewski, pilots of the Polish Air Force, who know that if the Luftwaffe isn't stopped, then Poland, Holland and France were just Hitler's hors d'oeuvres. So they are ready to fight, if they are given the planes. The problem is the British don't trust 'the bloody Poles'. And so the pilots, strangers in what seems a very strange land indeed, will over the course of a few months have to fight several wars at once - with the xenophobia of the authorities and the public, with the language, the unfamiliar Hurricane fighters, with the battle-hardened Luftwaffe.

Now, though, the Poles have a fresh enemy - themselves, as nerves and fatigue take a terrible toll on men pushed to the limit by constant aerial warfare, fighting to save their own country above a foreign land.
